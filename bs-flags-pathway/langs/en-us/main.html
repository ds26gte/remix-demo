<p>In the Bootstrap: Flags pathway, students will use knowledge of functions, function composition, transformations in the plane, and coordinates to build compound images. One provided activity is to produce flags for different countries, and teachers have extended this idea in many ways to have students produce custom emoji, a graphic of their name, a personal logo design, and more. The key outcome is that students reinforce their understanding of functions alongside spatial relationships and reasoning with two-dimensional shapes through practice and then through a graphical capstone activity at the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several elements of the path are key, foundational elements of many Bootstrap Paths. If your students have a strong understanding of circles of evaluation, contracts, or defining values, you can review them as you feel necessary without doing full lessons. These are all exercised heavily when using the image functions in the lessons that build up to Flags 1.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Themes</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A theme that exercises students’ understanding of contracts is that <strong>Images are values</strong> and due to this, <strong>Images can be arguments to functions</strong> and <strong>Images can be defined values</strong>. This theme runs through most of the image functions, is an instance of function composition, and is fundamental to building compound images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another theme is <strong>defining values</strong>. When creating compound images, the expressions that create them can get large, spanning many lines. A key organizational principle in both math and programming is to <strong>give names to the results of expressions</strong> to make other expressions and computations simpler. There are a lot of moments to discuss the organization of expressions as students build up bigger images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Staging</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The path is staged with an intermediate milestone and a final capstone. In the first milestone, students don’t yet interact with coordinates, and focus first on creating and transforming individual images (rotate, flip, scale), then composing them in terms of relative positions (above, beside, overlaid on top). It’s important to emphasize just how many flags can be built by putting images above and beside one another without using specific coordinates. You can get pretty creative even at the first milestone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this intermediate milestone, students then learn how to arrange images on top of one another based on specific x/y coordinates. This combines the practice with function composition along with review of the coordinate plane. With overlaying by coordinates in hand, students can more easily build complex images with off-center overlaid parts and more, and get quite creative.</p>
