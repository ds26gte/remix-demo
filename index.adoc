== Content repo

Content is arranged in pathways and lessons. The repo contains
two separate directories for them, viz., `pathways` and
`lessons`.

Each subdirectory of `pathways` is a pathway, e.g.,
`bs-flags-pathway`.

Each subdirectory of `lessons` is a lesson, e.g.,
`intro-to-dilations`, `image-transformations`,
`flags-of-the-world`.

We drill down `langs/en-us` to get to the sample content. (I.e.,
for now we only have English-US, but more langs are envisaged.)

== Pathway `bs-flags-pathway/langs/en-us`

Here there is an adoc
file for the pathway narrative. This is a single adoc file for
now, but I can imagine multiple narratives, or maybe sub-adoc
files included in the main one. If there is one chief narrative,
we may want to standardize its name, e.g., `main.adoc` or
`index.adoc`.

The file `workbook-index.rkt` contains a (Racket)
list of all the lessons, in order, contained in the pathway. The
lesson names would be precisely the name of the corresponding
subdirectories in the `lessons` hierarchy.

A subdirectory
`resources` contains additional files (adoc, Google Doc, PDF,
whatever) that are referred to in the pathway narrative.

== Lesson `lessons/langs/en-us/flags-of-the-world`

Here there is an
adoc file for the lesson plan (analog of the pathway narrative).
Again, this is a single adoc file for now, but we can decide if
there should be multiple or sub-files, and if the name should be
standardized. The need for a standardized name is more compelling
here, because this would ease reference by pathway narratives.

The subdirectory `exercises` contains adoc files for design
recipes, whether final or faulty. These would be referred to by
the lesson plan.

The subdirectory `images` contains image files
(jpgs, pngs) referred to by the lesson plan.

The subdirectory
`workbook-pages` contains pages in the lesson that are
constrained to be one page each. These are _not_ part of the
lesson plan (although they could be), but rather the pages that
are collated by pathway workbooks. The files can be either direct
PDF or adoc files that will be converted to PDF. Further, there
is a file `lesson-index.rkt` that contains a list of the lesson
pages in the right order.

== Building

At the top directory, the
call

  build-pathway bs-flags-pathway

(or for completion
convenience)

  build-pathway pathways/bs-flag-pathway

constructs
the workbook for `bs-flag-pathway` inside a newly created
subdirectory `distribution`. It creates the pathway narrative
HTML, its lesson PDFs, lesson plan HTML, and the pathwayâ€™s
workbook PDF from its constitutent lesson PDFs.

The resulting
hierarchy looks like

  distribution/bs-flags-pathway/langs/en-us/
     main.html                  # the pathway narrative, HTMLized
     workbook/workbook.pdf      # the pathway workbook
     lessons/
           flags-of-the-world/ index.html  # the lesson plan, HTMLized
           ... other lessons ...

The relevant CSS files are also available, as
also the individual PDFs in case they need to be inspected
separately.

== ToDo

- An option to the `build-pathway` script to
construct two different workbooks, one with solutions, one
without.

- A Travis CI that displays the finished narrative and
workbook on a standard URL.
